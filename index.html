                <p class="info-text">Rappi<br>I worked with refactoring and creating new microservices for the back-end with GoLang, Kafka, Mongodb, etc. technologies. I implemented software architectures and design to improve systems, created solutions and performance algorithms focusing on business rules and quality attributes of the delivery sector. I worked on the front-end team to create intuitive and reusable interfaces with technologies and standards such as Web Components and BEM CSS.</p>
                <p class="info-text">AtisWork - Cashin<br>At AtisWork I worked for one of their clients called Cashin. I was responsible for the technical and managerial part of the software's back-end team. Defining the software architecture and design with the team, helping to define tasks, carrying out code reviews and pull requests, developing in the GoLang language, writing tests for the application, checking doubts with the product team and ensuring the quality of the software.</p>
                <p class="info-text">CD2<br>I worked as a full stack mainly on the back end with technologies such as Golang, Gitlab, GRPC, SQL and API design. On the front end I worked with React Js and CSS. I worked alongside the project's SCRUM master, managing directly with the client, understanding their demands and suggesting improvements to the software. My team was very good and we managed to face many technical and non-technical challenges.</p>
